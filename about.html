<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2><hr></h2>
<p>I am Abdulhalim Suraju, a curious and creative thinker with a strong drive for building ideas into reality. I enjoy exploring the world of business and entrepreneurship, constantly shaping concepts that blend practicality with innovation. Whether it’s reimagining local ventures, like unique eateries, or drafting visionary platforms for services, I see opportunities where others see ordinary routines. Writing has also become part of my journey, as I channel my thoughts into projects like my upcoming book How Tax Makes You Poorer, where I reflect on systems that shape society and individuals alike.</p>

<p>At my core, I believe entrepreneurship is an art—designing systems that empower others while building lasting impact. I am not only interested in profit, but in the beauty of creating something meaningful, whether it’s through business strategy, design concepts, or academic projects. I also have a strong interest in knowledge: from biology study guides to financial insights, I love diving into new fields and finding ways to connect ideas. This curiosity fuels both my studies and my creative work.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and entrepreneurship, I carry a forward-looking mindset. I see myself not just as someone who participates in the system, but as someone who redesigns it. My passion for learning, creating, and leading makes me eager to grow into a role where my ideas can make a difference locally and globally. With each step I take—whether in business, writing, or study—I aim to build a life that inspires others to think bigger, act boldly, and chase possibilities that seem out of reach.</p>
